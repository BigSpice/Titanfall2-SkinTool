# Titanfall2-SkinTool
A tool for titanfall2 dds skin.Code not good,lol

1.	The skin should be packaged as a .zip package

2.	The folder for save texture can be divided into "2048", "1024", "512";folder depend on which image resolution is used.

3.	Texture file names should be “FormatName_ Default_ Texture. DDS "(Doesn't support Skin31)
    Example: CAR_Default_col.dds(Case Sensitive and No Space!)

(PS: Devotion is divided into two parts：the gun body should be “Devotion_ Default_ Col.dds”, and the clip should be “Devotion_ clip_ Default_ col.dds”)

Texture types can be written according to the types analyzed by rpak tool(ao，gls，nml，col，cav，spc，ilm)

It can be understood by combination with the Example Skin zip Files in the Example folder. Other files, folders and compressed package names doesn’t need the format requirements.
